          Hello! I’m Aditya Shedge, a dynamic and dedicated creative
          professional with one year of hands-on experience in video editing,
          animation, 3D design, and graphic design. I’m passionate about using
          my skills to turn ideas into captivating visual stories and innovative
          designs. In my first year in the industry, I’ve had the opportunity to
          work on diverse projects that have honed my abilities and deepened my
          love for visual arts. As a video editor, I focus on crafting engaging
          narratives and seamless edits that keep audiences hooked.

          My animation skills add an extra layer of excitement and creativity to
          projects, while my 3D design expertise allows me to create immersive
          and realistic digital environments. Graphic design is where I blend my
          artistic flair with practical design principles to create striking
          visuals and brand identities that make a lasting impression. I’m
          enthusiastic about continuing to grow and take on new creative
          challenges. If you’re looking for a fresh perspective and a
